      <h1 class="page-title">3D Animation and Modeling</h1>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        The first two forms of animation that I did were 2D hand-drawn animation
        and stop-motion animation. But after discovering 2D animation, I
        realized that I needed a PC to animate with, because my old laptop was
        not going to cut it. So I bought the needed parts and assembled a
        powerful workstation. While this was going on, my brother became
        interested in 3D modeling, something that I knew nothing about. I became
        interested, and realized that there were only two ingredients needed to
        create 3D: a powerful computer, and software. I had just bought a
        powerful computer, and my brother told me about this free 3D modeling
        software: Blender. I downloaded and opened Blender, not knowing a thing
        about it, and was instantly lost. So I asked my brother and he
        recommended this guy on Youtube, Blender Guru(Andrew Price), who could
        teach me how to use Blender. Like millions before me I did Blender
        Guru's Blender 2.8 Beginner tutorial series, which was 23 15ish minute
        lessons on how to model a doughnut and a cup of coffee. It took weeks of
        hard work to get it, but at the end I could use Blender, and make a
        doughnut. I first began 3D in May 2021, and I have improved alot since
        then. Now I can make a decent doughnut in about 5 minutes. Here is my 3D
        portfolio.

      <div class="page-introduction">
        After completing the beginner series, I expanded my horizon to other
        things, discovering such people as Ian Hubert and Steve from CG Geek
        along the way, who through their tutorial videos taught me more advanced
        Blender methods. So while doughnuts are the best, I do in fact have
        other 3D skills. Here are some other miscellaneous works.

        Underwater Reef: if you get the volumetrics right, you can make almost
        anything look like it is under water. I make a plane, gave it a sand
        material and put some rocks on it. I then made a cube, covered the whole
        thing and gave the cube a volume shader that I tweaked until it looked
        right. After that I added some low resolution icospheres and sticks
        being emitted from above to form water particles and junk. The fish were
        made by projecting a fish picture onto a fish shaped mesh, animating it
        going straight forward, and then using a displacement modifier with a
        clouds texture set to global coordinates. This made the fish wiggle like
        it was swimming. Then I duplicated the one fish, deleted the duplicate's
        animation data and parented it to the animated fish. I then just
        duplicated and scaled until I was happy. I learned many of the
        techniques from a video by Kev from KevBinge, and the fish were inspired
        by an Ian Hubert method.

        Putting a Kitchen into a City Appartment: I took a video of a kitchen,

        everything up correctly you can put live action footage into a 3D scene.
        I learned this from Ian Hubert.

        Drone on Desk: I took a video of my desk, motion tracked the footage in
        Blender, and took 6 additional pictures of the surronding environment. I
        configured these 6 pictures into a low-tech lighting soloution by
        putting them on planes in Blender, then putting those planes into a box
        formation around my subject. I modeled a droid and animated it doing
        droid stuff. The lighting provided a sense that the droid was in the
        space. I added a plane to catch the shadows and there it is, homebrew
        VFX.

        My favorite part about 3D is that you can create anything you can
        imagine. It is crazy! It also lets me see what movies are actually made
        of, and gives me a deeper appreciation for special effects. 3D is also
        an increasingly important skill in that it is in increasingly higher
        demand. Here is a video of me making a doughnut in Blender in about 5
        minutes.

        Andrew Price not only taught me how to use Blender, but he kindled my
        ever-growing love of doughnut renders. I cannot eat doughnuts but that
        does not mean that I do not appreciate their colorful and squishy
        qualities. Once you start rendering doughnut, it is hard to stop. Here
        are some of my doughnut renders.
