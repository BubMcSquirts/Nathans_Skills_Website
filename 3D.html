        The first two forms of animation that I did were 2D hand-drawn animation
        and stop-motion animation. But after discovering 2D animation, I
        realized that I needed a PC to animate with, because my old laptop was
        not going to cut it. So I bought the needed parts and assembled a
        powerful workstation. While this was going on, my brother became
        interested in 3D modeling, something that I knew nothing about. I became
        interested, and realized that there were only two ingredients needed to
        create 3D: a powerful computer, and software. I had just bought a
        powerful computer, and my brother told me about this free 3D modeling
        software:
        <a class="text-links" href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank"
          >Blender</a
        >. I downloaded and opened Blender, not knowing a thing about it, and
        was instantly lost. So I asked my brother and he recommended this guy on
        Youtube,
        <a

        cup of coffee. It took weeks of hard work to get it, but at the end I
        could use Blender, and make a doughnut. I first began 3D in May 2021,
        and I have improved alot since then. Now I can make a decent doughnut in
        about 5 minutes. Here is my 3D portfolio.

        along the way, who through their tutorial videos taught me more advanced
        Blender methods. So while doughnuts are the best, I do in fact have
        other 3D skills. Here are some other miscellaneous works.

        Underwater Reef: if you get the volumetrics right, you can make almost
        anything look like it is under water. I make a plane, gave it a sand
        material and put some rocks on it. I then made a cube, covered the whole
        thing and gave the cube a volume shader that I tweaked until it looked
        right. After that I added some low resolution icospheres and sticks
        being emitted from above to form water particles and junk. The fish were
        made by projecting a fish picture onto a fish shaped mesh, animating it
        going straight forward, and then using a displacement modifier with a
        clouds texture set to global coordinates. This made the fish wiggle like
        it was swimming. Then I duplicated the one fish, deleted the duplicate's
        animation data and parented it to the animated fish. I then just
        duplicated and scaled until I was happy. I learned many of the

        not the most photo-realistic works I have done so far. I made it by
        animating some rectangles and putting the images of our wood samples on
        them, a different stain for either side. This proved to be a more
        difficult task then one might think, as putting two image textures on
        one object and separating them by a set divide in a natural way is
        tricky to do in Blender, at least so far as I could tell. I ended up
        using a gradient texture and color-ramp node to achieve this effect.
