      <div class="page-introduction-start">Hello!</div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        My name is Nathan, I am 17 years old, and I am a Christian and I live in
        the United States. This website is where I put what I consider to be my
        best creations: a portfolio. Most activities on this website are ones
        that I have picked up within the last 4 years, since I was about 13.
        Before then, I did not even know what a video editor was, or what frames
        in a movie were. But that is not to say that those first 13 years of my
        life did not contribute to these activities. On the contrary, I believe
        that my education has greatly contributed to any successes that I may
        have.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        I have been home schooled for all of my life, and my parents were very
        intentional about my education. I owe much to the ideas that they
        instilled in me. Without them it is doubtful whether I would have ever
        created any of the things seen on this website. Although I was not
        explicitly taught any of these things in school, my parents instilled in
        me a healthy curiosity about how things work, why they work, and how to
        make them work. Without this inquisitive mindset I would never be able
        to persist in my hobbies, all of which are time consuming and have
        delayed gratification, and no guaranteed success.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        My parents have been very supportive of my hobbies, and very
        understanding of their requirements. They supported me even when I had
        little results. They are my biggest fans, and I really appreciate that.
        I love my family, they are the best.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="introduction-box">
      <div class="about-page-headings">About This Website</div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        As previously mentioned this is my portfolio website. Why did I decide
        to create this site? The answer is not to toot my own horn. The purpose
        of this site is to accurately reflect the skills that I have, with no
        embellishments. What you see is what you get. I do not believe in social
        media in general, and I want a place to share my work with people. So if
        I tell someone that I am an animator and they ask to see some of my
        work, I can refer them here.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        I also have dreams of doing one, some or all of these activities as a
        job one day. If ever I apply for a job in one of these fields I can send
        this website to my possible employer as a reflection of my abilities. I
        have a photo editing job, and that is a good start, but editing endless
        furniture photos is not my dream.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        Being naturally introverted, I tend to never to share any of my works
        with other people. My own family often does not see my creations. I am
        not one to spontaneously talk about myself. My hope is that this website
        will contain all of the information that anyone ever needs to know about
        me, so that I hardly ever have to talk about myself again.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="introduction-box">
      <div class="about-page-headings">Who is Nathan?</div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        As previously mentioned, my name is Nathan and I am 17 years old. What
        do I look like? Where do I live? How tall am I? What is my last name?
        What is my cousin's brother's aunt's dad's favourite food truck? These
        are all questions that I do not seek to answer. All you need to know
        about me is that my name is Nathan, I am 17, I am a Christian, and I am
        an American.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        I naturally do not trust the internet, so why would I trust it with a
        picture of myself? I do not wish to have my image in a database. There
        are plenty of Americans, plenty of Nathans, and plenty of teenagers, so
        I figured that this discription of myself still gives me a decent amount
        of obscurity.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        Why bother telling you I am a Christian? Because that is something that
        I do want you to know. I wish it to be my difining feature, the most
        obvious thing about me. Since there are objective standards of beauty
        and creativity set by God I am free to create what honors God, and
        therefor is pleasing to me. If you have any questions about Christianity
        I would highly encourage you to go to visit Answers In Genesis, where
        you can find many answers to any questions you may have. And most
        importantly, pick up a Bible. Although the Bible can be intimidating, it
        is the infallible truth. Begin in the book of Matthew in order to grasp
        the gospel message. If you do not have access to a Bible, there is a
        link to a free online Bible in the resources.
