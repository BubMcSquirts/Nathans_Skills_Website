      <div class="page-introduction">
        I cannot remember exactly when I began video editing, but I should say
        it coincided with my obsession with water bottle flipping. Naturally,
        such an extraordinary feat as flipping a plastic bottle in the air and
        landing it upright engendered in me a desire to share this achievment
        with the world. So I discovered iMovie, Apple's video editor that Macs
        come with. I used the very same camcorder that I implemented as a means
        of stop motion, aimed it at my subject and recorded whatever I wanted. I
        then imported the video into iMovie, made some cuts and exported the
        video. All this took place while my laptop's fans were screaming for
        mercy as they did their best to impersonate a rocket ship taking flight.
        The system worked, but it could have been better.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        Then I discovered Blender, that oh so free and open source solution to
        all of life's creative problems. It was amazing! The people at the
        Blender Institute are not joking when they say that Blender can run on a
        potato. If I remember correctly, it ran faster than iMovie, but not fast
        enough for my ambitions.
      </div>
      <div class="page-introduction">
        After a couple of years I bought myself a powerful PC. Now Blender was
        ridiculously fast. But it's feature set is lacking in some ways,
        especially for the new user. So I researched other options, and I came
        upon DaVinci Resolve, and now I have access to Adobe Premiere Pro as
        well. These professional level video editors are great, and it is good
        to know how to use them, but lately I have found myself using Blender
        more again. Since I began with Blender they have added new features to
        the video editor that make it much more usable, and I am also more
        comfortable with the program in general than I was. But if Blender
        cannot handle something, I just use Adobe Premiere Pro.

        As for examples of videos I have edited, all the videos on this site
        have been edited in either Adobe Premiere Pro or Blender. Here are some:
