        While animation is currently only a hobby for me, photo editing is my
        job. I work for Solid Custom Heirlooms, a custom furniture maker based
        in Ohio and started by my grandfather. My job is to edit the photos that
        go out to the world, and can be found at our website:
        SolidCustomHeirlooms.com. I use Adobe Photoshop, and with it I edit
        endless amounts of photos, hardly any of which are high quality to begin
        with. On our website, there are between 8 and 12 photos in the average
        furniture listing, and there are over 380 listings, almost all of which
        I have edited since I began the job in spring 2021. So that is to say
        that I have had my fair share of photo editing. Here is a video I made
        describing the editing process:

        Photo Editing Demo Video: This is the process I use for editing photos
        at work for the furniture buisiness. I do this... but about 30 times a
        day.

        However, I also do photography as a hobby. I have a Nikon D3500, and
        whenever I go on a trip to somewhere I know there will be good photos, I
        take my camera. I cannot say that I am a great photographer, but editing
        endless amounts of low quality photos has given me a great idea of what
        a good photo is not. Here are some of my hobby photos.

        I had the opportunity to photograph this classic Schwinn bike, which we
        found used at a bike shop. The bike was $75, and after some upgrades we
        must have put around $125 total into it. Even though we put practically
        nothing into it ($125 is super cheap for a bike), these photos stand as
        good examples of how the right lighting and a bit of water from a hose
        can make something kind of junky look more expensive than it is.
