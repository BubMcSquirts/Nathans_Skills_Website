      <div class="page-introduction">
        Stop motion was the first form of animation that I happened upon. When I
        was 13 I had a cheap camcorder that I used to record various things:
        water bottle flipping, basketball trick shots, and other such great
        activities. Then I discovered that if I pressed the photo button on the
        camcorder while recording a video I could pause the video. If I did
        this, I could then move to a different spot and press the photo button
        again, which would resume the recording process. This looked like I had
        edited the video, when in reality I had just pressed a button. Then I
        discovered that if I pressed the photo button twice very quickly I could
        capture a very minuscule amount of time. I had LEGO, so I decided to
        take some movies of my minifigures doing various things with this method
        I had newly found, pressing the pause button twice very quickly, moving
        the LEGO man, and then doing the same thing over and over again. I had
        discovered stop-motion when I had no idea what it was or that it
        existed.

        WAR! One of my first stop-motion animations. I just set up a camera and
        went straight ahead.

          I showed my parents what I had made, and announced that I had
          discovered this new thing that let you make LEGO men look like they
          were moving! My parents told me that although I had discovered it,
          stop-motion was not a new thing. They told me that it was what was
          used to create Wallace and Gromit, which I was familiar with. Although
          a little crest-fallen that I was not the first to use stop-motion, I
          was excited about it none the less. Today I do not use a camcorder,
          but a DSLR camera and Dragonframe to create my animations. Here is one
          of my recent animations with clay and thumb-tacks:
