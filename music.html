          From ages 4 to 14 I played the piano as my instrument. I performed in
          recitals and took lessons for over 10 years. However, in 2020 I was
          forced to stop taking piano lessons because of Covid, and I have not
          taken lessons since, although I can still play. In 2020 I discovered
          electronic music production through the music instructor Taetro, and
          when I was 15 I got my first midi keyboard and a copy of the
          DAW(Digital Audio Workstation) FL Studio. I began making music with
          that and greatly enjoyed it. In 2021 I got a bigger keyboard and a
          copy of Ableton Live, which has become my primary Daw. I enjoy
          Ableton's workflow more, although FL Studio is still better for some
          things. Here are some of my electronically produced songs. The ones
          here were made in Ableton Live with an Artutia MiniLab MK II midi
          controller.

        Then, in late 2021 I got a guitar. I taught myself to play it. Guitar
        has become my primary instrument, and I enjoy playing it very much. Here
        is a video of me performing Blackbird by The Beatles.

      <div class="content-discription">
        Blackbird by The Beatles: I performed this on the Taylor GS Mini using a
        Shure SM57 microphone recorded into Ableton Live. Blackbird is probably
        one of the most popular finger-style guitar songs.

        I learned from free resources, and benefited from many people. As
        previously mentioned I learned electronic music production from Taetro,
        and I learned guitar from primarily Justin from Justin Guitar and Marty
        from Marty Music.
