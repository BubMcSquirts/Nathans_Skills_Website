        When I was 13 I discovered stop-motion animation, and I came to the
        gradual realization that all movies were composed of pictures played in
        quick succession. I then realized that these could be any pictures,
        including drawn ones. I looked up some resources and discovered how to
        animate, and discovered Howard Wimshurst too. In 2020 I took a course by
        him, Getting Started in 2D Animation, which helped me animate
        effectively. Here are some of my animations.

          Even though people usually think of Blender as a 3D modeling and
          animation software, it can also be used for 2D animation. I discovered
          this in my search for animation software, and tried it out. I used
          Blender for 2D animation until I switched to Krita as my primary 2D
          animation software in 2021. Blender is surprisingly great for 2D
          animation, but it does lack some features. It has a vector based
          brush, and so far as I know there are very few ways to make it look
          like a real pen. But Blender is still fantastic though in that it has
          very advanced timeline features. On the other hand, Krita has great
          brushes, but its animation interface is very limited. Out of the two I
          find that each has its pros and cons.

        I have since enjoyed 2D animating, and it has given me a deeper
        appreciation of 2D films, and a sadness that they are no longer created,
        except for low-quality cartoons. My favorite 2D Movie is The Emperors
        New Groove.

      <div class="page-introduction">
        As a 2D as well as 3D animator, the combination of the two arts is
        interesting to me. I have only dabbled in it, but the results are quite
        intriging. Here is an example where I animated a 3D mountain and used it
        as a reference to trace over with 2D. It is quite effective.
